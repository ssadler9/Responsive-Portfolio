# Basic-Portfolio

Hi!

This Responsive Portfolio looks very similar to the Basic-Portfolio at first glance, but if you adjust he window size, you'll see that it's very different!

There are three separate breakpoints coded into each element.  The first breakpoint is set at 980px.  You will notice the About, Portfolio and Contact will jump to align with the center of the Connect with Me box.  The Portfolio page changes dramtically at this break point.  The pictures will shift from a column of two pictures to 1 with an overflow element!

The second breakpoint is at 768px.  You will notice the Connect with Me box move under the About Me and Portfolio sections.  This is to keep the user from having to laterally scroll the page.

The third breakpoint is set for 640px.  Designed for an iPad, the webpage looks entirely different.  My name and background is stretched all across the top of the page.  The links to About, Portfolio and Contact will slide directly under my name to take up the rest of the top of the screen.

Getting used to  @media and breapoints was a real challenge.  Feel free to leave comments if you see any room for improvements!
