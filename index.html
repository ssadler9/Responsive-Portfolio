           My name is Sam Sadler.  I am from Henderson, TX.  There wasn't a lot to do in Henderson growing up, so I resorted to playing sports and video games!  Golf has always been my passion.  I have been playing for as long as I can remember.  I'd have to say my favorite game was Halo 2!

           After college, I got married to my best friend, Melanie.  We lived in Houston for a while after we got married.  I was the First Assistant Golf Professional at Woodforest Golf Club.  We finally got to move back to Austin after I got a job at indeed!  That career change made a huge impact on both of our lives.  Needless to say, I wouldn't have gotten back into the world of Code without it!

          I really enjoy spending time outside with my family.  We have two dogs: Bo, he's a Labradoodle, and Aria, she's a minature schnauzer.  We go on hikes, bike rides, camping trips etc.. I'm also a big gaming fan!
